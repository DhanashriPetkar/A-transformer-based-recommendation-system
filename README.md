# A-transformer-based-recommendation-system

Project Overview
This project implements a recommendation system using the Transformer model, specifically the Behavior Sequence Transformer (BST). The model predicts user ratings for movies based on their viewing history and profile information.

Description
The system utilizes the Behavior Sequence Transformer model to predict movie ratings. It leverages user behavior, profile data, and movie features.

Introduction
The BST model is based on the research paper by Qiwei Chen et al. It uses sequential user behavior and additional features to make predictions.

Dataset
Name: MovieLens
Source: MovieLens Dataset
Model and Approach
The BST model predicts the rating of a target movie by considering:

User's historical movie ratings.
User profile information.
Movie features.
Instructions

Setup Environment:
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (TensorFlow, NumPy, etc.).

Data Preparation:
Download the MovieLens dataset.
Preprocess the data to fit the model's input requirements.

Training the Model:
Train the BST model using the prepared dataset.
Monitor the training process and adjust parameters if necessary.

Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set.
Check the prediction accuracy and adjust the model if required.

Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict ratings for new user-movie pairs.
